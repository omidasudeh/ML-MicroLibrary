# Run instruction:
## Note: 
- As the experiments were time consuming I have written a map-reduce like script to submit the code to the cluster (I ran on chpc) 
- I used pandas, numpy, and pickle libraries, make sure you have them installed (pip3 install --user pandas)
- for convenience .ipynp notebooks also provided (random_forest.ipynp)

## For Part2: question 2.d
- run "pytohn3 random_forest.py <Number_Of_Iterations> <Number_Of_Attributes>"
- e.g. **"python3 random_forest.py 5 2"**
